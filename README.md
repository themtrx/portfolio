# Basic portfolio website

I am using React and ReactBootstrap.
There is no server side. No need for now.
For next version I have idea to build Admin panel for easier page content update.
Then I will need to create backend.

## Pages

There is only one page. Actually two if we count the error page.
For this reason there was need to implement React routing.
Very simple rooting:
- Main Page
- Error page
